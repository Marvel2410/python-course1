2.	Imagine you’re at a job interview for a Python developer role. The interviewer says 
“Explain logical operators in Python”. Draft how you would respond.

Logical operators are used to combine conditions in expressions.  They basically allow you to perform
different actions based on whether certain conditions are true or false (boolean).  For example, the 'and'
operator returns True if both conditions are true.  Similarly, 'or' checks if at least one of the condtions is true.


3.	What are functions in Python? When and why are they useful?

Functions in Python are blocks of code that perform specific tasks.  They help in organizing code and making it
reusable, so instead of writing the same code multiple times, you can define a function once and call it whenever
you need that functionality.  


4.	In the section for Exercise 1 in this Learning Journal, you were asked in question 
3 to set some goals for yourself while you complete this course.  In preparation for your 
next mentor call, make some notes on how you’ve progressed towards your goals so far.

As far as goals, I feel I have definitely taken on the first one.  I am learning the basics, and also understanding them 
fairly quickly. I am really enjoying playing within the practice exercises and tasks.  I feel more confident in Python thus 
far and I am looking forward to the rest of the achievement.  I really learned the importance of indentation during this lesson.


GOALS:(from Journal 1.1)
- Learn the basics:  Start by understanding the basic syntax and concepts of Python.  I also want to practice
writing simple programs to get a feel for how Python works.
- Explore Python Libraries: I want to explore the Python libraries and frameworks that are commonly used,
such as Flask or Django.  See what those libraries do in a real-world project.
- Build/Complete a project:  Apply what I've learned and create a side Python project of my own.  (After
completing )
