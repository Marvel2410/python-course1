1.	Do some research on Django models. In your own words, write down how Django models work and what their benefits are.

Ddjango models are like blueprints for your database. They help you define the structure of your data, like what kind of 
information each part of your app will store. For example, if you're making a recipe app, you'd have a model for recipes 
that might include fields like name, ingredients, and cooking instructions. The benefits of Django models are that they make 
it easier to work with your data in your code, help you avoid mistakes, and make your app more organized.


2.	In your own words, explain why it is crucial to write test cases from the beginning of a project. 
You can take an example project to explain your answer.

It's crucial to write test cases from the beginning of a project because they help you catch mistakes and bugs early 
on. An example woudl be building a recipe app, and you forget to add a field for ingredients in your recipe model. 
If you had written a test case for that model, it would have failed, alerting you to the problem before it caused 
any issues in your app. Tests also help you understand how different parts of your app should work together, making 
it easier to add new features or make changes later on.
